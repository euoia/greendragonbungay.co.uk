        <h3>A new beer store</h3>
        <h5>
          Published 24<sup>th</sup> January 2022, by
          <a href="mailto: james@greendragonbungay.co.uk">James Pickard</a>
        </h5>
        <h4 id="background">Background</h4>
        <p>
          As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the pub, we needed more
          space to store our beer.
        </p>
        <h4 id="a-small-space">A small space</h4>
        <p>
          For years, we&apos;ve struggled with an undersized cold store for our
          beer. When I say undersized, what I mean is that we are constantly
          brewing &quot;just in time&quot; to ensure there&apos;s enough space
          for the newly brewed beer. The beer store can hold a maximum of about
          two brews of beer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the beer store is so small, whenever a new batch of beer is
          ready, we have to unload everything to get the new stuff in. This is
          basic stock rotation. However, when you&apos;re dealing with 9, 18 and
          36 gallon barrels, this can be a lot of hard, heavy lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to all this work rotating stock, the lack of space means
          we are limited to what we can brew. It makes it difficult for us to
          make a strong dark winter special, ideally brewed months in advance,
          because of the precious space it occupies. It also means that our brew
          schedule is strictly dictated by demand from the pub. Planning around
          this and taking holiday is hard.
        </p>
        <h4 id="towards-a-solution">Towards a solution</h4>
        <p>
          For the last year or so, we&apos;ve been thinking seriously about what
          could be done. My father&apos;s workshop, located next to the brewery,
          seemed to be the ideal space. It receives a lot less direct sun than
          the current beer store, and has the potential to be much better
          insulated. It just needed decluttering. Years of accumulated odds and
          sods from the pub and brewery needed organising, giving away, selling,
          throwing away, repurposing. Over the course of several weeks in autumn
          2021 we did this, and at the same time we planning how to use the
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between the brewery team, we came up with a plan to split the space
          into thirds, allowing the leftmost third as space for the cold store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peter Fisher from ACM Ltd, based in Norwich, came to visit us and from
          our conversations sketched a design.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            style="max-width: 100%"
            src="/img/beer-store-sketch.png"
            alt="A sketch of the beer store"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          We sat on this, happy with the design. The quote seemed reasonable,
          but was on the high end of what we were able to afford. We were trying
          to figure out how to make it work.
        </p>
        <h4 id="a-timely-email">A timely email</h4>
        <p>
          Then in September, through Bungay Events and Business Association, I
          received an email advising me that East Suffolk Council had launched a
          new grant for businesses affected by Covid-19 restrictions. This
          &quot;Plan for the Future&quot; grant scheme seemed to be a really
          good match for our beer store project:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Businesses which are looking to bring forward investment projects
            that will have a significant impact on their business will be able
            to apply for grants of between &pound;5,000 and &pound;25,000 to
            help support their projects.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I sent an email to East Suffolk council and within hours Margaret
          Oakley at the New Anglia Growth Hub had responded with some
          registration forms, helpfully partially completed based on the
          information they already held about us. The forms themselves do ask
          for quite a bit of detail, but Margaret responded very quickly to all
          my queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the following day the registration forms had been completed I was
          assigned a growth advisor, Robert Turnbull, also at the New Anglia
          Growth Hub. Robert called me that day, and we had a long chat about
          the project. Robert listened carefully and was able offer excellent
          advice on how to complete the application form. Again, the form
          required some technical detail, and in every case Robert was able to
          provide a clear and concise answer on how to complete it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course the next few weeks, working through the details of the
          application form - figures from my accountant, how much state aid
          we&apos;d already received, turnover, balance sheet, etc - I finally
          managed to complete the final bits and submit our application on
          October 1st. A couple of weeks later, on the 15th of October, our
          application was approved!
        </p>
        <h4 id="a-small-rethink">A small rethink</h4>
        <p>
          Once the grant application was approved, we knew we&apos;d be okay to
          schedule the work. With that in mind, we had another look at our
          plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          A local refrigeration engineer, and a regular at the pub, Bo came to
          look at the space. Bo is an expert in this field and has been working
          with refrigerated spaces for years. He advised us to try to envisage
          exactly how we would use the cold room. This exercise proved
          invaluable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with my father, Digby and Luke, we started pacing the space out,
          laying it out with masking tape on the floor, shifting versions of
          where the barrels would go.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest problems with the existing beer store is that once
          it starts to get full, there&apos;s really no room to move around.
          When we started looking at the space with these barrels in place, we
          realised that having 3 sliding doors would not only overcomplicated
          things, it resulted in multiple &quot;channels&quot; that did not make
          the best use of the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          After thinking things through, we asked Peter to come back and
          consider a plan using the rear half of the workshop instead of just
          the leftmost third. This would mean we could get away with only one
          large sliding door instead of three smaller ones, and would give us a
          lot more usable space. In retrospect, I believe this was the correct
          choice - it&apos;s a much better design overall.
        </p>
        <h4 id="a-job-well-done">A job well done</h4>
        <p>
          In the second week of December, ACM send their team to install the
          cold room. They work very quickly and professionally, completely
          nearly all of the work in 2 days. A week later, Beeline Refrigeration
          come and install the cooler and LED illumination. The only thing left
          to install is the door, a 1500mm wide custom built sliding door made
          from foam covered with sheet steel and PVC. ACM return a few days
          later and install it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            style="max-width: 100%"
            src="/img/beer-store-2.jpg"
            alt="A photo of the completed beer store"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I&apos;m very happy with the result. The workmanship is of
          the highest quality and the additional breathing room it gives us
          means that there is much less work moving barrels as part of the stock
          rotation. Now, with the larger beer store, we can potentially look at
          slightly increasing production - perhaps producing a kegged product to
          sit alongside the craft kegged beers that we have been buy in as part
          of our ever-changing craft beer selection at the pub. This will not
          only make us more competitive, but will create a product that&apos;s
          brewed onsite instead of couriered to the pub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to East Suffolk for the Plan to the Future Grant, and the New
          Anglia Growth Hub for being so helpful during the application process.
          Thanks to ACM and Beeline for their patience and professionalism
          throughout the build process.
